The next major release of rspamd: `1.1.0` is now released. In this version, I did another bunch of
architectural rework. This time, I've refactored fuzzy storage, regular expressions processing and statistics primarily. 

A number of features that I was asked constantly about have been added to rspamd, including such features as:

* **Autolearning** for BAYES: statistics can learn on good or bad messages automatically
* **Redis** backend for statistics to enable distributed and fast redis storage for rspamd cluster
* **Scalable fuzzy storage**: it is now possible to scale hashes storage across multiple processes to process thousands of requests per second

There is also major performance improvement: [hyperscan](https://github.com/01org/hyperscan) engine support for optimizing regular expressiosn execution.

With this version, I have added a lot of documentation, including [tutorials]({{ site.baseurl }}/doc/tutorials/) and improved [quick start guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/doc/tutorials/quickstart.html).

Here is the full changelog for this version available on GitHub: <https://github.com/rspamd/rspamd/blob/1.1.0/ChangeLog>

The new version is almost 100% backward compatible with `1.0` branch but please check the [migration]({{ site.baseurl }}/doc/tutorials/migration.html) document if you are using per-user statistics and rspamd-1.0.

Here are some graph of rspamd performance on scanning:

So you can see that rspamd can scan as much as 200 messages per second consuming less that 50% cpu of a typical scanner machine (Xeon E5405 single CPU).

[Rmilter]({{ site.baseurl }}/rmilter/) is also upgraded to the version `1.7.0` that brings full IPv6 support, redis cache support and major cleanup of unused and broken stuff. Rmilter changelog is available here: <https://github.com/vstakhov/rmilter/blob/1.7.0/ChangeLog>
