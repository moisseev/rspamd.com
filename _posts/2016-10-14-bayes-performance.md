title:  "Rspamd bayes engine benchmark"

---

I have recently decided to compare [Bayes classifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes_classifier) in `Rspamd` with the closest analogues. I have tried 3 competitors:

1. **`Rspamd`**(version 1.4 git master)
2. **`Bogofilter`** - classical bayesian filter
3. **`Dspam`** - the most advanced bayesian filter used by many projects and people

For `Dspam`, I have tested both `chain` and `osb` tokenization modes. I have tried to test `chi-square` probabilities combiner (since the same algorithm is used in `Rspamd`), however, I could not make it working somehow.

## Testing methodology

First of all, I have collected some corpus of messages with about 1k of spam messages and 1k of ham messages. All messages were carefully selected and manually checked. Then, I have written a small [script](https://github.com/rspamd/rspamd/blob/master/utils/classifier_test.pl) that performs the following steps:

1. Split corpus **randomly** into two equal parts with about **500** messages of Ham and Spam correspondingly.
2. Learn bayes classifier using the desired spam filtering engine (`-d` for Dspam, `-b` for Bogofilter).
3. Use the rest of messages to test classifier after learning procedure.
4. Use **95%** confidence factor for `Rspamd` and `Dspam` (e.g. when probability of spam is less than 95% then consider that a classifier is in undefined state, `Bogofilter`, in turn, automatically provides 3 results: `spam`, `ham`, `undefined`).

This script collects 6 main values for each classifier:

1. Spam/Ham detection rate - number of messages that are **correctly** recognized as spam and ham
2. Spam FP rate - number of false positives for Spam: **HAM** messages that are recognized as **SPAM**
3. Ham FP rate - number of false positives for Ham: **SPAM** messages that are recognized as **HAM**
4. Ham and Spam FN rate - number of messages that are not recognized as Ham or Spam (but not classified as the opposite class, meaning uncertainty for a classifier)

The worse error for a classifier is Spam False Positive, since it detects an **innocent** message as **Spam**. Ham FP and false negatives are more permissive: they just mean that you receive *more* spam than you want.

## Results

The raw results are pasted at the following [gist](https://gist.github.com/vstakhov/a8e2cf931d87a88622b8d33245fce83c).

Here are the corresponding graphs for detection rate and errors for the competitors.

## Conclusions

`Rspamd` Bayes performs very well comparing to the competitors. It provides higher spam detection rate comparing to both `Dspam` and `Bogofilter`. All competitors demonstrated the common spam false positives rate. However, `Dspam` is more aggressive in marking messages as Ham (which is not bad because Bayes is the only check `Dspam` provides).

`Rspamd` is also much **faster** in learning and testing. With Redis backend, it learns 1k messages in less than 5 seconds. `Dspam` and `Bogofilter` both require about 30 seconds to learn.

I have not included `SpamAssassin` into the comparison since it uses naive Bayes classifier similar to `Bogofilter`. Hence, it's quality is very close to `Bogofilter's` one.

Furthermore, unlike competitors, `Rspamd` provides a lot of other checks and features. The goal of this particular benchmark was to compare merely **Bayesian** engines of different spam filters. To summarise, I can conclude that quality of Bayes classifier in `Rspamd` is *high enough* to recommend it for using in the production environments or to replace `Dspam` or `Bogofilter` in your email system.
